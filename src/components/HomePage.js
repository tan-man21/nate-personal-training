                    <p>At the start of his fitness journey, Nate weighed just 119 pounds, with little
                    knowledge or direction regarding how to maximize his health, function, and
                    performance. Fast forward a few years, and under the guidance of various trainers,
                    Nate went on to place 1st in two separate Classic Physique bodybuilding competitions
                    (Novice â€“ OCB and NPC). As a personal trainer, he understands what it&#39;s like to be at
                    both ends of the fitness spectrum and has witnessed firsthand the transformative impact
                    that proper diet and training can have. These experiences inspired him to help others
                    improve their health, performance, and function, just as he did for himself.</p>
